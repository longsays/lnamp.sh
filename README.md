#ABOUT THE SCRIPT

Debian 7 minimal setup script modified from actgod.com, which allows easily Linux+Nginx+Apache+Mysql+Php setup(some calls it LNAMP) on even a 64M lowend VPS.  

I have been using the damnp-actgod.sh for over two years, finally I found it not working any more on Debian 7. I spend some time to modify it, it is not a easy work for this Linux newbee.
